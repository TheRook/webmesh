# Basic Auth Example

This example shows using the basic-auth plugin to protect the mesh.
This is not a recommended architecture (at least without also using TLS), but it is a good example of how to use the plugin.
For mTLS examples, the [operator](https://github.com/webmeshproj/operator) provides an easier setup and playground via cert-manager.

Start and stop the example the same as the others.
